Every recursive has two major cases:

base case - in which the task is simple enough to be solved without further calling of the same function (base acts as a terminating condition)
recursive case - in which the task in divided into smaller sub-parts and solution is got by combing these smaller sub-parts

This works similar to finding a  factorial of a number

#eg
5!
5=5x4x3x2x1
